I want to make a MERFISH subcellular visualization tool on the website. I want to plot it using three.js. There will be millions of dots plotted for each gene, so performance is crucial. In addition, I also want to have cell boundaries displayed, so that the user can see the entire cell. In the end, it will get the data from a backend in json format, or compressed, but for now, just maek up your own data and run it locally. Make sure it has reactive global variables that are accessible between files. And make sure there is also a level of details so when you zoom out, it will not plot everything. For the cell boundaries, the data input will be a json file with the coordinates of the cell boundaries. 

The genes json is in the folder genes. And the cell_boundaries json can be found at cell_boundaries/cell_boundaries.json. For the cell boundaries, you can also subsample the amount of points for each polygon or line point.
